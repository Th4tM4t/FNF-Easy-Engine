# FNF-Easy-Engine
Friday Night Funkin' Easy Engine is a FNF Engine running off of a different engine then haxeflixel (what the original game used) Named "GDevelop 5." This Engine is amazing for people who want to make games but cant code. 

This engine is COMPLETELY Open source. What makes this even better is that not only do you not have to code to make your mod,
The engine is extremely modifiable. In friday night funkin' Kade Engine, Psych Engine (easier then kade) You may not be able to modify EVERY SINGLE Feature in the game.
Now i have never made a fnf mod. That's why me and you are here. 

Please note:
**This engine is in pure beta, 0.0.1 has not even been worked on yet.** (at the time of writing this.)

It would help if some of you could take the sprites from the sheets and make them separated sprite's, because i don't know how to use sprite sheet's on gdevelop 5 yet.
